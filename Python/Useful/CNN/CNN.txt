CNN

What I learned
  -CNN arguably most popular Deep Learning Architecture
  -CNNs make use of spacial data, unlike others
  -3 Layer types : Convultional, Pooling, fully connected Layer
  -MNIST Dataset only worked with solid Accuracy and processing time due to the small size of the images (28x28), 
   otherwise it wouldn't be computationaly possible
  -Pooling layers reduce the amount of parameters, increasing efficiency
  -Convultion: Learn certain image features
  -Kernel Matrix moves in strides (1 Stride = moving one column further every iteration)
  -the bigger the stride, the smaller the corresponding feature map 
  -multiply every color value with kernel value and add to receive a sum,then divide by num of fields to receive average 
  => store value in the new and smaller feature map, repeat until the end of the end

  -Kernel = feature detector 
  -every Kernel is designed to have a destinct set of weights, changed 
  -weight sharing allows to create filters that can be used in different parts of th image
  -in the beginning (first layers) edges, shapes are detected and as we go deeper more high level info is filtered 
  => images might become unrecognizable in deeper layers as they start to build on top of each other
  
  -Fully connected layer is responsible for classification 
  -updating weights and biases with backpropagation using gradient descent
  -the more filters, the more features can be detected
  -combining all feature maps creates convolution
  -with RGB pictures 3x3 Kernel would become a 3x3x3 Kernel

  -Relu : Matrix multiplication and addition is linear, Relu introduces linearity
  -Sigmoid and tanh are easier affected by vanishing gradient (multiplying more and more small numbers with each other)
  -Relu : Multiplying by gradient of one doesn't lead to vanishing gradient
  -Filters preserve old image, after all the Feature maps have been created, Relu is passed over the images
  => Relu converts all negative values to 0
  -max pooling: outputs maximum values in the given area (exmple 2x2), reduces computational complexity
  -scales images down while still preserving features, helps reduce overfitting
  -if max pooling is too large, map is scaled down too much

  the points mentioned above will be studied in practice by implementing a CNN to classify the MNIST Dataset, afterwards we can compare   how   much more efficiently and accurately a CNN can classify images be compared to a normal NN
  
    drop out layer:
  - randomly setting fraction of input nodes to 0 => nodes are turned off
  - everytime it updates paramters, radnom set of nodes is turned off (different set every time)
  - helps reduce overfitting, as it forces the network to use various combination of nodes to classify data
  - NN becomes more versatile allows weights to be better distriputed
  - only used during training process, in testing drop out is turned off
  => in testing nodes can combine all their independent learning 
  - redundancy is created, as following Neuron "listens" to different input Neurons
  - 0.5 is the recommended value by the researchers (50%)
  - implemented in between fully connected layers (larger number of parameters)
  
  Paramter Sharing in CNNS:
  -Reduces amount of parameters drastically
  -Same weights and biases used in each depth slice(= 2D slice for example[55x55x96]
  -every neuron will still perfrom gradient descent for it's weights, but these will be added up and only change a single set of weights    per slice
  -Based on the idea that if a ceratin feature is useful at some location in the image, it should intuitively be useful at some other location
  
  Data Augmentation

- Taking existing images and transforming, altering it 
- allows model to look at more variety, especially useful with small data sets
- can be done by rotating, zooming in ,changing color, ...
- import ImageDataGenerator which allows us to set ranges 
- model.fit_generator runs image generator in parallel with model training
