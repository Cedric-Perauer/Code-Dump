# Projekt_Fahrzeugquartett_V5
Project in C++ College Class 

Project served as an example for working together in Groups on a larger project, however only the Class.h and .cpp files were finished at the end.
Functional goal was to read different data (based on Category of vehicle) from txt files and then play a card game against the computer. 
So far only one of these classes has been implemented, 
the rest could be added with a similar logic that compares the values in a different way as in the PKW class 
as the comparison between chosen attributes has to differ. (e.g. more payload is better than less payload, but lower 0-60 is better than higher 0-60)

What I learned

- It's important to use header files, and functions to make a project more readable (could be improved in the main.cpp by adding extra classes)
- Use of polymorphism allows us to make code very efficient while using many classes 
- Fisher Yates Shuffle algorithm
